It suggests the next word based on user input using basic NLP concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- Word prediction
- Context awareness using previous words
- Random next-word suggestion
- Beginner-friendly implementation

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- n-gram model (Bigram)
- Basic probability logic

## 🛠 Technology Used
- Python

## ▶ How It Works
The model learns word sequences from a dataset.
When a user enters a word, it predicts the next possible word.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add web interface (Streamlit)
